# Recurrent Neural Networks project: Time Series Prediction and Text Generation
In this project I have built RNNs that can generate sequences based on input data - with a focus on two applications: With the first I've used real market data in order to predict future Apple stock prices using an RNN model. The second one is trained on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel Sherlock Holmes and will generate wacky sentences based on it.

## Instructions
The requirements can be seen in `requirements.txt` file.

Just follow the `RNN_project.ipynb` notebook for further instructions and if possible run the model on a GPU since RNNs are resource intensive.
